## 🎯 Production Readiness Assessment

The master test runner automatically assesses production readiness based on:

### 📈 Scoring System
- **Integration Tests**: 30% weight
- **Performance**: 25% weight
- **Load Testing**: 25% weight
- **Security**: 20% weight

### 🏆 Readiness Levels
- **READY** (90-100): Approved for production deployment
- **READY_WITH_WARNINGS** (85-89): Approved with conditions
- **NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT** (70-84): Deployment not recommended
- **NOT_READY** (<70): Deployment blocked

### 🚦 Deployment Decision Matrix

| Category | Excellent | Good | Acceptable | Poor |
|----------|-----------|------|------------|------|
| Integration | 95-100% | 90-94% | 85-89% | <85% |
| Performance | <1s avg | 1-2s avg | 2-3s avg | >3s avg |
| Load | 50+ users | 20-49 users | 10-19 users | <10 users |
| Security | 95-100% | 90-94% | 85-89% | <85% |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Database Connection Errors
```bash
# Reset database
npm run db:reset
npm run db:generate
```

#### 2. API Key Issues
```bash
# Verify environment variables
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

#### 3. Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is available
lsof -i :3000
```

#### 4. Memory Issues
```bash
# Increase Node.js memory limit
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
```

### Test Failures

#### Integration Test Failures
- Check API endpoints are responding
- Verify database connectivity
- Ensure test data is properly created/cleaned

#### Performance Issues
- Check system resources
- Verify database indexes
- Review API optimization

#### Load Test Failures
- Increase system resources
- Check for memory leaks
