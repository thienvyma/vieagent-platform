# Refactor Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan for refactoring the AI Agent Platform from its current structure to a more maintainable, feature-based folder structure. The refactoring will be done in phases to minimize disruption and ensure that the application remains functional throughout the process.

## Phase 1 – Component Cleanup

### Objectives
- Identify and categorize all components
- Move UI components to appropriate locations
- Standardize component naming and structure
- Implement proper component exports

### Tasks
1. Audit all components in `/src/components/`
2. Identify reusable UI components vs. feature-specific components
3. Move reusable UI components to `/src/components/ui/`
4. Group feature-specific components in their respective feature folders
5. Update imports throughout the codebase
6. Test components to ensure they function correctly after relocation

## Phase 2 – API Refactor

### Objectives
- Standardize API response formats
- Organize API routes by feature
- Improve error handling
- Implement proper typing for API requests and responses

### Tasks
1. Audit all API routes in `/src/app/api/`
2. Create consistent response format for all API endpoints
3. Group API routes by feature
4. Implement proper error handling for all API routes
5. Add TypeScript interfaces for all API requests and responses
6. Update client-side code to use the refactored API routes
7. Test API endpoints to ensure they function correctly

## Phase 3 – Layout Restructure

### Objectives
- Create a consistent layout system
- Separate layout concerns from page components
- Improve responsiveness and accessibility

### Tasks
1. Audit all layout components
2. Create a unified layout system
3. Extract layout components from page components
4. Implement responsive design for all layouts
5. Improve accessibility for all layouts
6. Test layouts on different devices and screen sizes

## Phase 4 – Remove Dead Files

### Objectives
- Identify and remove unused code
- Clean up imports and dependencies
- Reduce bundle size

### Tasks
1. Use static analysis tools to identify unused files
2. Verify that identified files are truly unused
3. Remove unused files and update imports
4. Clean up unused dependencies in package.json
5. Test application to ensure removal didn't break functionality

## Phase 5 – Import Path Cleanup

### Objectives
- Standardize import paths
- Use path aliases for cleaner imports
- Reduce import complexity

### Tasks
1. Configure path aliases in tsconfig.json
2. Update imports to use path aliases
3. Standardize import order and formatting
4. Remove circular dependencies
5. Test application to ensure imports work correctly

## Phase 6 – Final Folder Structure & Documentation

### Objectives
- Implement feature-based folder structure
- Update documentation
- Ensure codebase is maintainable and scalable

### Tasks
1. Create final folder structure based on features
2. Move files to their appropriate locations
3. Update imports throughout the codebase
4. Create comprehensive documentation for the new structure
5. Update README.md with new project structure
6. Test application to ensure it functions correctly with the new structure

## Timeline and Dependencies

Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next phase. The estimated timeline for each phase is:

1. Component Cleanup: 1-2 days
2. API Refactor: 2-3 days
3. Layout Restructure: 1-2 days
4. Remove Dead Files: 1 day
5. Import Path Cleanup: 1 day
6. Final Folder Structure & Documentation: 2-3 days

Total estimated time: 8-12 days

## Risk Mitigation

- Create a backup of the codebase before starting each phase
- Work in a separate branch for each phase
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Perform thorough testing after each phase
- Have a rollback plan in case of major issues
